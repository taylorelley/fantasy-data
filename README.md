- etc.

### Summary Files (`{ROUND}-{RACE}/summary_data/`)

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  BASE_URL:
    "https://fantasy.formula1.com/en/statistics/details?tab=driver&filter=fPoints",
  BROWSER_HEADLESS: false, // Set to true for headless mode
  PROCESS_ALL_DRIVERS: true,
  DELAYS: {
    PAGE_LOAD: 5000,
    POPUP_WAIT: 3000,
    BETWEEN_DRIVERS: 2000,
    POPUP_CLOSE: 1000,
  },
};

// Output directories are now automatically created as versioned folders
// based on the most recent race (e.g., "15-Netherlands/driver_data/")
```

## 🏎️ Team Swap Handling

The scraper automatically detects and handles drivers who switched teams mid-season:

### Current Team Swap Drivers (2025 Season)

- **Yuki Tsunoda**: Red Bull Racing → Racing Bulls
- **Liam Lawson**: Racing Bulls → Red Bull Racing

### How It Works

1. **Detection**: Identifies multiple entries for the same driver with different teams
2. **Collection**: Gathers race data from both team periods
3. **Merging**: Combines data into a single comprehensive driver record
4. **Conflict Resolution**: When the same race has different data, chooses the version with more points
5. **Metadata**: Includes team swap details and version tracking

## 📈 Points Breakdown

Fantasy points are broken down by category:

### Race Points

- **Position Points**: Based on finishing position
- **Qualifying Points**: Based on qualifying position
- **Driver of the Day**: 10 points bonus
- **Fastest Lap**: Points for fastest lap
- **Overtake Bonus**: Points for positions gained/lost

### Sprint Points (Sprint weekends only)

- **Sprint Position**: Based on sprint finishing position
- **Sprint Qualifying**: Based on sprint qualifying position
- **Sprint Fastest Lap**: Points for sprint fastest lap
- **Sprint Overtake Bonus**: Points for sprint positions gained/lost
